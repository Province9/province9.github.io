A guitarist  from the age of four, he went through high school and college disguised as a  French horn player. He began his teaching career with a three-year stint as  the school band director for the Central-Texas community of Mart. It was there  that he started his first school jazz band, learning along with his students  and staying slightly ahead of them by reading each lesson of the group's class  method book the night before he introduced it to the band. Apparently it  worked; during the band's first year of existence it placed at the  then-prestigious Brownwood Stage Band Festival. In his six years as band  director in Ingleside, he regularly produced first-division concert, marching,  and jazz bands. The jazz band he started there was the first public-school  stage band in South Texas to rehearse on a daily basis. He came to Del Mar  College in 1972. During his tenure at the school, the jazz bands have  performed with many of the greatest names in jazz. In 1987, the MWF Jazz Band  toured Europe, appearing at Holland's North Sea Festival and Switzerland's  Montreux Festival. In addition to his duties as jazz band director, Irving  teaches jazz appreciation, the history of rock music, and beginning guitar. He  has recently completed work on his guitar class method, titled Learn To Play  the Guitar in Three Easy Lessons (and Twenty Hard Ones). Irving is a member of  Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music, and is an  honorary member of Phi Sigma local professional music sorority.</p> <p>The Fraternity has had some form of presence at the nation\u2019s largest music  educators convention since the 1980s. That presence has grown over the past  few years thanks to Brother David Irving, Gamma Theta (North Texas University)  1960. The Phi Mu Alpha Booth at TMEA now sees over 800 Brothers annually and  has become an official part of the Official Exhibit Booth program of the  National Headquarters.</p> <p>It was Brother Irving who began forging a consistent place for the Fraternity  at the convention starting with small booth spaces that he paid for by  himself. He would help offset the costs of the booth by selling Fraternity  history books that were provided by the National Headquarters. As his efforts  grew, so did the booth\u2019s attraction to alumni and friends of Fraternity.</p> <p>At the 1985 National Assembly, Brother Edward Klint, Alpha Xi (The University  of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) 1978, coordinated a Step Sing. The next year,  in 1986, Brother Irving recreated that experience at the TMEA Convention by  gathering a small group of Brothers at San Antonio\u2019s Grand Hyatt Riverwalk  Mezzanine to sing and share in the comradery of the event.</p> <p>Originally known as the \u201cTexas Sing,\u201d it became what is now Phi Mu Alpha\u2019s  Annual TMEA Step Sing, and the thirty-some Brothers at that first sing has  grown into hundreds. By 1992, the Step Sing had well outgrown its original  location and moved to its current venue inside the Convention Center to better  accommodate the number of Brothers and audience members in attendance. Today  the TMEA Step Sing is perhaps one of the largest regular gatherings of  Sinfonian Brothers in the nation, and attendance continues to steadily  increase.</p> <p>It is nothing more than a testament to the strength of Phi Mu Alpha\u2019s bonds of  Brotherhood that a man can gather together with others for nothing more than  to share in a song with another or to rekindle his fire for the Fraternity. It  is because of humble beginnings and the dedication of a few that the small  booth at TMEA has become an event that is looked forward to yearly by many.</p>"},{"location":"alumni/","title":"Alumni","text":"<p>Welcome to the Alumni page!
