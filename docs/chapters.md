## _Kappa Chi_: Del Mar College

**Date Founded:** March 4, 1962

**Number of Active Brothers:** 8

**Current Pledge Class:** Delta Lambda

**About:**  Del Mar College is the home to Kappa Chi which is the only active 
chapter at a two-year college in the country. Kappa Chi has stood the test of 
time as a chapter recruiting new Brothers with each passing year despite lower 
enrollment than at a four-year university. 

Our main goal this semester is to be more active with our high school events 
and our local events. We as Sinfonians are dedicated to spreading as much 
music to the younger generation and helping any in need of guidance.
