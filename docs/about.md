# About

Province 9 is a regional division of the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity, located
in Central and South Texas. 

## Leadership
Leadership at the Province level is a mixture of appointed alumni and elective
active brothers. The Province Governor and Deputy Province Governor are appointed
by the National President. The Province Alumni Coordinator is then appointed by 
the Province Governor.

Because of the size of the Province, Province 9 has two dedicated Assistant Collegiate Province Representatives (ACPRs), one for the North and one for the South.

### Province Alumni Coordinator - Chirs Silva
![Chris Silva Headshot](https://github.com/masonegger.png){: style="height:200px;width:200px" align=left}

Hello Brothers, 

I am Chris Silva, your Province Alumni Coordinator. I was
initiated in Fall 2006 at Kappa Chi at Del Mar College. At KX, I served as
FEO before transferring to TAMUCC with Rho Epsilon and serving as FEO
and as President. I also served one year as ACPR South. I didn’t graduate
from TAMUCC as I moved to San Antonio, but I eventually completed my
B.S. in Information Technology through an online institution. I landed a
job at Rackspace and worked until I landed my current job with A Cloud
Guru (A Pluralsight Company). I am part of the team that creates and
updates training content for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, along with
DevOps and Security. If you’re familiar with the company, you’ve heard my
voice and learned how to do various things across these disciplines from
my videos.

As a Collegiate Brother, I always enjoyed spending time with the Brothers and travelling around. I attended Leadership Institute twice (once in Nashville 
and once in Evansville) and National Convention 2009 in Orlando. Some of the 
best Brotherhood Development I’ve experienced has been in those 20+ hour car 
rides across the country! As your PAC, I hope to be a resource for the AROs in 
developing strong Alumnirelations. I was nervous but excited about the 
opportunity when Shawn asked me to be PAC. The Fraternity has had its fair 
share of setbacks over the last few years, and rebuilding trust and confidence 
in the organization within our Alumni base is of utmost importance as this 
body makes up the vast majority of the organization. I want to help the AROs 
develop strategies and create opportunities for strong Alumni engagement to 
rebuild trust and confidence in the organization and help rekindle Sinfonia’s 
fire within our Alumni Brothers. While my focus is on Alumni Relations, I am 
available as a resource to any Brothers in need. Please don’t hesitate to 
reach out if you need anything, have questions, or want to chat or get the
opinion of some old guy. 

_Fraternally, Chris Silva, KX ‘06 PAC_

### Collegiate Province Representative - Victor Briseno

Hello Brothers! 

My name is Victor Briseño and I am a master’s student at Texas State University and an award-winning mariachi/opera vocalist hailing from Kingsville, TX. While pursuing my bachelor’s degree, I heard about Phi Mu Alpha, a fraternity aligned with my values and aspirations, and felt a strong calling to join. In the Spring of 2021, I crossed and joined the ranks of the distinguished Gamma Phi Chapter with the class of Zeta Zeta. Soon after, I adeptly fulfilled the roles and responsibilities of the Fraternal Education Officer (FEO), Assistant Fraternal Education Officer (AFEO), Treasurer, Fundraising Committee Head, and Brotherhood Committee Head. I have also, over my course of time, served on every committee in my chapter and actively work on increasing intraprovincial relationships by making lifelong friends in other chapters.

Recently acclaimed as the elected Chapter Province Representative (CPR) for Province 9, I stand poised to become a recognizable and approachable figurehead, a pillar of support and guidance for my fellow brothers and chapters. In this role, I envision amplifying the interactivity within the province, facilitating meaningful exchanges, building chapter leaders, solving looming or worrisome issues, and collaboratively charting the course for the province's collective journey beyond the challenges posed by the pandemic. I am beyond excited to work for the Province Council, but truthfully I am more enlivened by the mere fact that I get to serve the brothers of the prestigious and powerful Province 9. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if there is anything I can do to help you or your chapters. You can find all my socials down below.

_On And Ever Upwards,_

_Victor M. Briseno - Collegiate Province Rep. of Province 9_
