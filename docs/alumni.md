# Alumni

Welcome to the Alumni page! On this page we want to celebrate all things Alumni in Phi Mu Alpha. 

## Alumni Programs

Alumni Brothers make up for the vast majority of our Fraternity. The true 
power in numbers we have as a Fraternity comes from the Brothers who are left 
to recall their college days. With that said, the Fraternity has recently 
launched an Alumni Program called **1898Forward** which aims to assist the 
Fraternity financially. The push is to get every Alumni Brother to donate 
$18.98 to help our Fraternity sustain financially. For more information, visit
the [1898 website](https://1898forward.org).

## Alumni Associations

Alumni Associations are meant to be a continuation of your journey in Phi Mu 
Alpha after you’ve become an Alumni. These meetings are typically informal
gatherings with very little business as the bulk of the time in these meetings 
is meant for spending time with Brothers. Each Alumni Association has a 
similar officer structure to Collegiate Chapters, however the expectation is 
not to run like a Collegiate Chapter, it’s more for the purpose of handling 
the business needs of the Alumni Association. 

### San Antonio Area Alumni Association
The San Antonio Alumni Association is currently the only active Alumni 
association within Province 9. While the association hasn’t gathered 
in quite some time, it is still active. The last meeting of the Alumni 
Association was in 2017 and it would be awesome to get the San 
Antonio Area Alumni Association back up and running! 

### Corpus Christi Area Alumni Association (In Progress) 
There is an Alumni Association interest group forming in Corpus Christi. 
They are working to gather enough Brothers for a charter as an official Alumni 
Association in the area. It would be awesome to have an Alumni Association in 
the southern part of the Province as we’d then have two central hubs for 
Alumni to gather!

If you are in the San Antonio or Corpus Christi area and would be interested in helping build or rebuild the Alumni Association, please reach out to [Chris Silva](mailto:chris@province9.org) at [chris@province9.org](mailto:chris@province9.org).
