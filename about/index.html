<h1 id="about">About<a class="headerlink" href="#about" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Province 9 is a regional division of the <a href="https://sinfonia.org">Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity</a>, located
in Central and South Texas. </p>
<h2 id="phi-mu-alpha-sinfonia">Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia<a class="headerlink" href="#phi-mu-alpha-sinfonia" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia is the world’s oldest and largest secret national 
fraternal society in music. Sinfonia was born on October 6, 1898, at the New 
England Conservatory in Boston, when a group of thirteen young men under the 
guidance of Ossian Everett Mills met “to consider the social life of the young 
men students of that institution [and] to devise ways and means by which it 
might be improved.” Sinfonia became a national fraternity on October 6, 1900, 
with the admission of a group of men at the Broad Street Conservatory in 
Philadelphia. For over a century, Sinfonians in nearly every field of study 
and professional endeavor have transformed music in America. The opportunity 
of becoming a Sinfonian is offered to as many men as possible who, through 
a love for music, can assist in the fulfillment of the Fraternity’s Object and 
ideals either by adopting music as a profession or by working to advance the 
cause of music in America.</p>
<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission<a class="headerlink" href="#our-mission" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Object of this Fraternity shall be for the development of the best and truest fraternal spirit; the mutual welfare and brotherhood of musical students; the advancement of music in America and a loyalty to the Alma Mater.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="province-9-leadership">Province 9 Leadership<a class="headerlink" href="#province-9-leadership" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Leadership at the Province level is a mixture of appointed alumni and elective
active brothers. The Province Governor and Deputy Province Governor are appointed
by the National President. The Province Alumni Coordinator is then appointed by 
the Province Governor.</p>
<p>Because of the size of the Province, Province 9 has two dedicated Assistant Collegiate Province Representatives (ACPRs), one for the North and one for the South.</p>

<p>Hello Brothers, </p>
<p>I am Chris Silva, your Province Alumni Coordinator. I was
initiated in Fall 2006 at Kappa Chi at Del Mar College. At KX, I served as
FEO before transferring to TAMUCC with Rho Epsilon and serving as FEO
and as President. I also served one year as ACPR South. I didn’t graduate
from TAMUCC as I moved to San Antonio, but I eventually completed my
B.S. in Information Technology through an online institution. I landed a
job at Rackspace and worked until I landed my current job with A Cloud
Guru (A Pluralsight Company). I am part of the team that creates and
updates training content for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, along with
DevOps and Security. If you’re familiar with the company, you’ve heard my
voice and learned how to do various things across these disciplines from
my videos.</p>
<p>As a Collegiate Brother, I always enjoyed spending time with the Brothers and travelling around. I attended Leadership Institute twice (once in Nashville 
and once in Evansville) and National Convention 2009 in Orlando. Some of the 
best Brotherhood Development I’ve experienced has been in those 20+ hour car 
rides across the country! As your PAC, I hope to be a resource for the AROs in 
developing strong Alumnirelations. I was nervous but excited about the 
opportunity when Shawn asked me to be PAC. The Fraternity has had its fair 
share of setbacks over the last few years, and rebuilding trust and confidence 
in the organization within our Alumni base is of utmost importance as this 
body makes up the vast majority of the organization. I want to help the AROs 
develop strategies and create opportunities for strong Alumni engagement to 
rebuild trust and confidence in the organization and help rekindle Sinfonia’s 
fire within our Alumni Brothers. While my focus is on Alumni Relations, I am 
available as a resource to any Brothers in need. Please don’t hesitate to 
reach out if you need anything, have questions, or want to chat or get the
opinion of some old guy. </p>
<p><em>Fraternally, Chris Silva, KX ‘06 PAC</em></p>

<p>Hello Brothers! </p>
<p>My name is Victor Briseño and I am a master’s student at Texas State 
University and an award-winning mariachi/opera vocalist hailing from 
Kingsville, TX. While pursuing my bachelor’s degree, I heard about Phi Mu 
Alpha, a fraternity aligned with my values and aspirations, and felt a strong 
calling to join. In the Spring of 2021, I crossed and joined the ranks of the 
distinguished Gamma Phi Chapter with the class of Zeta Zeta. Soon after, I 
adeptly fulfilled the roles and responsibilities of the Fraternal Education 
Officer (FEO), Assistant Fraternal Education Officer (AFEO), Treasurer, 
Fundraising Committee Head, and Brotherhood Committee Head. I have also, over 
my course of time, served on every committee in my chapter and actively work 
on increasing intraprovincial relationships by making lifelong friends in 
other chapters.</p>
<p>Recently acclaimed as the elected Chapter Province Representative (CPR) for 
Province 9, I stand poised to become a recognizable and approachable 
figurehead, a pillar of support and guidance for my fellow brothers and 
chapters. In this role, I envision amplifying the interactivity within the 
province, facilitating meaningful exchanges, building chapter leaders, solving 
looming or worrisome issues, and collaboratively charting the course for the 
province's collective journey beyond the challenges posed by the pandemic. I 
am beyond excited to work for the Province Council, but truthfully I am more 
enlivened by the mere fact that I get to serve the brothers of the prestigious 
and powerful Province 9. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if there is 
anything I can do to help you or your chapters. You can find all my socials 
down below.</p>

<p><img align="left" alt="David Irving Headshot" src="../assets/photos/david.jpg" style="height:400px;width:300px" /></p>
<p>A native of Corpus Christi, earned his bachelor's and master's degrees at 
North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas). A guitarist 
from the age of four, he went through high school and college disguised as a 
French horn player. He began his teaching career with a three-year stint as 
the school band director for the Central-Texas community of Mart. It was there 
that he started his first school jazz band, learning along with his students 
and staying slightly ahead of them by reading each lesson of the group's class 
method book the night before he introduced it to the band. Apparently it 
worked; during the band's first year of existence it placed at the 
then-prestigious Brownwood Stage Band Festival. In his six years as band 
director in Ingleside, he regularly produced first-division concert, marching, 
and jazz bands. The jazz band he started there was the first public-school 
stage band in South Texas to rehearse on a daily basis. He came to Del Mar 
College in 1972. During his tenure at the school, the jazz bands have 
performed with many of the greatest names in jazz. In 1987, the MWF Jazz Band 
toured Europe, appearing at Holland's North Sea Festival and Switzerland's 
Montreux Festival. In addition to his duties as jazz band director, Irving 
teaches jazz appreciation, the history of rock music, and beginning guitar. He 
has recently completed work on his guitar class method, titled Learn To Play 
the Guitar in Three Easy Lessons (and Twenty Hard Ones). Irving is a member of 
Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music, and is an 
honorary member of Phi Sigma local professional music sorority.</p>
<p>The Fraternity has had some form of presence at the nation’s largest music 
educators convention since the 1980s. That presence has grown over the past 
few years thanks to Brother David Irving, Gamma Theta (North Texas University) 
1960. The Phi Mu Alpha Booth at TMEA now sees over 800 Brothers annually and 
has become an official part of the Official Exhibit Booth program of the 
National Headquarters.</p>
<p>It was Brother Irving who began forging a consistent place for the Fraternity 
at the convention starting with small booth spaces that he paid for by 
himself. He would help offset the costs of the booth by selling Fraternity 
history books that were provided by the National Headquarters. As his efforts 
grew, so did the booth’s attraction to alumni and friends of Fraternity.</p>
<p>At the 1985 National Assembly, Brother Edward Klint, Alpha Xi (The University 
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) 1978, coordinated a Step Sing. The next year, 
in 1986, Brother Irving recreated that experience at the TMEA Convention by 
gathering a small group of Brothers at San Antonio’s Grand Hyatt Riverwalk 
Mezzanine to sing and share in the comradery of the event.</p>
<p>Originally known as the “Texas Sing,” it became what is now Phi Mu Alpha’s 
Annual TMEA Step Sing, and the thirty-some Brothers at that first sing has 
grown into hundreds. By 1992, the Step Sing had well outgrown its original 
location and moved to its current venue inside the Convention Center to better 
accommodate the number of Brothers and audience members in attendance. Today 
the TMEA Step Sing is perhaps one of the largest regular gatherings of 
Sinfonian Brothers in the nation, and attendance continues to steadily 
increase.</p>
<p>It is nothing more than a testament to the strength of Phi Mu Alpha’s bonds of 
Brotherhood that a man can gather together with others for nothing more than 
to share in a song with another or to rekindle his fire for the Fraternity. It 
is because of humble beginnings and the dedication of a few that the small 
booth at TMEA has become an event that is looked forward to yearly by many.</p>
